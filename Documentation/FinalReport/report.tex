\section*{Abstract}
Baryonic matter, of which we are primarily composed of, is itself composed of three quarks.
These baryons include the proton and neutron, which we know as the core constituents of the 
nucleus. There also exists the traditional mesons, which are composed of only two quarks. This begs the question:
do particles composed of groups larger than a trio of quarks exist? The short answer is yes, 
with the first observation of a tetraquark - a particle composed of four quarks - being made 
in 2003 by the Belle Collaboration \cite{MultiquarkDiscovery}.
In this paper, the search for possible multiquark states using strange particles, namely, the 
$K^0_s$ meson and the $\Lambda^0$ baryon is done using data collected by the ATLAS detector 
of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =$ \SI{13.6}{TeV}. Minimum
bias data from 2015 boasting an integrated luminosity of \SI{21.559}{nb}$^{-1}$ is used. Secondary 
vertices are marked as either a $K^0_s$ or $\Lambda^0$ using strict cuts and their invariant mass and 
lifetimes are fitted for verification. A low energy resonant state of the $K^0_sK^0_s$ invariant 
mass distribution was detected at 1524.40 $\pm$ 4.83 MeV which likely corresponds to the 
$f_2'(1525)$ state. With this known signal identified, a bump hunt is performed on the higher-energy
range of the $K^0_sK^0_s$, $K^0_s\Lambda^0$ and $\Lambda^0\Lambda^0$ invariant mass spectra
in search for possible tetraquark, pentaquark and hexaquark states. WILL I FIND ANYTHING?

\section{Introduction}
From the discovery of various exotic particles such as pions in the 50's to that of the Higgs
boson in 2012, the advent of particle accelerators brought about new discoveries in particle physics,
bolstering our grasp on the standard model - a guage theory which describes three out of the four
fundamental forces, that being the weak, strong, and electromagnetic forces \cite{KLDiscovery}, \cite{HiggsDiscovery}. 
As the collision energies of particle accelerators steadily increase, new discoveries of higher mass particles 
can be made. 
Multiquarks are an example of these higher mass particles, being made up of collections of quarks
whose number exceeds that of the usual two or three we observe in mesons and baryons respectively.
Such particles are not forbidden by the standard model, and a proper identification of multiquark 
states may help in our understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) - a core component of the standard 
model which describes the interactions between quarks and the elementary particle which mediates 
the strong interaction between them: the gluon. Thus, this work searches for multiquark states 
through the possible decay products of tetraquarks, pentaquarks and hexaquarks. The decay channels
are as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Tetraquark}: A &\rightarrow K^0_sK^0_s \\
\text{Pentaquark}: B &\rightarrow K^0_s\Lambda^0 \\
\text{Hexaquark}:  C &\rightarrow \Lambda^0\Lambda^0
\end{align*}

Where the $K^0_s$ meson is a neutral kaon composed of a down quark $(d)$ and an
anti-strange quark $(\bar{s})$, and the $\Lambda^0$, known as the Lambda baryon,
is composed of an up, down and strange quark $(uds)$. Quarks are known to
possess one of the three fundamental color charges, of which there are three:
Red, Green or Blue. According to the color confinement principle, a core tenet
of QCD, color-charged particles such as quarks cannot be isolated, and thus
quarks combine to form color-neutral hadrons called singlet states. Nothing
forbids the creation of a singlet state composed of two quarks and two
antiquarks $(qq\bar{q}\bar{q})$, a particle called a tetraquark which would be
categorized as an exotic meson since, despite not being composed of a single
quark-antiquark pair, it nonetheless possesses a meson's characteristic trait of
being a hadron with a baryon number of zero. Similarly, nothing forbids the
combination of a color-neutral baryon and a quark-antiquark pair $(qqqq\bar{q})$
which we would call a pentaquark. A combination of two baryons or three
quark-antiquark pairs could also exist $(q^6 \text{ or } q^3\bar{q}^{3})$, which
are both example of hexaquarks.

\subsection{Event Reconstruction}
The $K^0_s$ and $\Lambda^0$ are chosen as objects of study due to their decay
products being easily identifiable within the ATLAS (A Torroidal LHC Apparatus) 
detector. The $K^0_s$ is
known to decay into two charged pions $(\pi^+\pi^-)$ with a branching ratio of
$69.20 \pm 0.05 \unit{\%}$ \cite{KBranchingRatio} and the $\Lambda^0$ decays
into into a proton and a pion $(p^+\pi^-)$ with a branching ratio of $63.9 \pm
0.5 \unit{\%}$ \cite{LBranchingRatio}. These charged particles are traced back to 
a secondary vertex (denoted $V0$) and the $K^0_s$ or $\Lambda^0$ invariant mass is reconstructed using the
respective decay product's energies and momenta.
The invariant mass of this two-particle 
decay (in nautral units) is given by:
\begin{equation}
M = \sqrt{(E_1 + E_2)^2 - ||p_1 + p_2||^2}.\label{equation: invmass} 
\end{equation}
Once two secondary vertices are reconstructed within a single event, the process 
can be repeated to reconstruct the invariant mass of the primary vertex, which is the point 
of the $p-p$ collision, once again using 
equation \ref{equation: invmass}. The resulting primary vertex invariant mass distribution can then be 
searched for possible multiquark states.
Before this can be done, however, cuts must be placed on the reconstructed $V0$s
to reduce the background and ensure no misidentification of particles occur.

\section{Methods}
Each $V0$ is considered a potential $K^0_s$ and $\Lambda^0$ candidate and is subject 
to a series of cuts in order to properly categorize the secondary vertex. This is because 
the ATLAS detector obtains only data on the momentum and charge of the pions and protons.
The trouble lies in differentiating the $p^+$ from $\pi^+$, as the  $\pi^-$ are easily 
identifiable. In order to accomplish this, the invariant mass of each secondary vertex 
is computed twice: once with the proton mass, and another with the pion mass. The cuts are 
then used to determine which hypothesis was correct, as well as reduce the overall background.
The cuts are as follows:\\

  \caption{\small Kinematic variables of a $K^0_s \rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-$ decay process.}\label{figure: KinematicVariables}
\end{wrapfigure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cut on transverse momentum: $p_T$
    \item Cut on pointing angle: $\cos(\theta)$ 
    \item Cut on distance travelled: $d$
    \item Cut on invariant mass: $m_{\pi^+\pi^-}$
    \item Cut on invariant mass: $m_{p^+\pi^-}$
\end{itemize}

With $p_T$ and $\cos(\theta)$ being given by:
\begin{equation}
    p_T = \sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \cos(\theta) = \frac{\Delta x p_x + \Delta y p_y}{p_Td}
\end{equation}
Where $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ are the differences in $x$ and $y$ coordinates between the primary 
and secondary vertices and the equation for $\cos(\theta)$ comes from the dot product between the 
vectors $\vec{R}$ (the path vector whose magnitude is $d$) and $\vec{p}$, the reconstructed momentum, 
as per figure \ref{figure: KinematicVariables}.
