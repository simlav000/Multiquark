## Getting set up

The multiquark analysis software is divided up into two parts. One is a private 
repo hosted on GitLab, which requires CERN credentials to access,
and can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/slavoie/MyAnalysis). The second
part is hosted on my public GitHub account and can be found
[here](https://github.com/simlav000/Multiquark).

## GitLab Repo
This repo is my project which uses the AnalysisBase 25.2.2 release build 
provided by ATLAS software. It is intended to be ran on `lxplus`. To get it up 
and running, it is recommended to simply clone the repo in your personal 
`eos` space. This can be found at `/eos/user/[first letter of username]/[username]`
