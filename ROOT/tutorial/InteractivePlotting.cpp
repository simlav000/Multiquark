// A very useful interactive tool is the FitPanel, available for the classes
// TGraphErrors and TH1F. Predefined fit functions can be selected from a 
// drop-down menu, including "gaus", "expo", and "pol0" - "pol9". Additionally,
// user-defined functions using the same syntax as for functions with parameters
// are possible!
//
// After setting the initial parameters, a fit of the selected function to the 
// data of the graph can be performed and the result displayed on the plot.
// The fit panel has a number of control options to select the fit method,
// fix or release individual parameters in the fit, to steer the level of output
// printed on the console, or to extract and display additional information
// like contour lines showing parameter correlations. 
//
// Once you are satisfied with your plot, you will probably want to save it.
// You can search for the "Save as..." option from the menu line of the window.
// It will pop up a file selector box to allow you to choose the format, file
// name and target directory. 
// There is one very noticeable feature here: you can store a plot as a ROOT 
// macro! In this macro, you find the C++ representation of all methods and
// classes involved in generating the plot. This is a valuable source of 
// information for your own macros.
