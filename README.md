# Multiquark
Repository for plotting and utility related to a research project searching for
multiquark states in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This contains scripts and
results to analyze the data generated by my AnalysisBase project which can be 
found [[here https://gitlab.cern.ch/slavoie/MyAnalysis]] (requires cern 
credentials).
